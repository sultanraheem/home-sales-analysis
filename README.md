# Home Sales Analysis Project

## Overview  
This project analyzes home sales data to uncover market trends, key price drivers, and build predictive models. Using a comprehensive dataset, it demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning techniques to forecast home sale prices.

## Repository Contents  
- **data/** — Raw and processed datasets  
- **notebooks/** — Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling  
- **scripts/** — Python scripts for data processing and model training  
- **reports/** — Generated visualizations and reports  
- **requirements.txt** — Python dependencies  
- **README.md** — Project overview and instructions

## Dataset  
The dataset includes home sale records with features like price, location, size, bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property details.

## Key Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
